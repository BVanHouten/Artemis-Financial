# Artemis-Financial
Artemis Financial operates as a financial services business which provides customized service plans for its customer base. The company maintains strong security protocols to defend sensitive information transmissions and block unauthorized entry during information transfer. The experience of running dependency tests for vulnerability detection proved extremely rewarding to me. The creation of secure code serves as a required step to eliminate potential threats hackers may leverage. Software security enhances company credibility by building trust between clients so their business increases. 
Determining real false positives in vulnerability assessment work proved to be a difficult part of the process. The improvement of security started with adding an SSL certificate and establishing HTTP posts support for the project. For future vulnerability assessment and mitigation techniques evaluation I will concentrate on precise identification and elimination of false positive findings. The security and operational functionality of the developed code and software application required repeated project tests and dependency checks. The updated code received another project run to detect newly introduced vulnerabilities. 
Future efforts require the web browser in Eclipse to be the primary tool for managing projects because this viewing method proved most beneficial in our current work. The Vulnerability Assessment Report stands out as my main assignment because it demonstrates my competence in processing security information for analysis and action.
